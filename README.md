# Colorfull

Colorfull is my 2024 Swift Student Challenge submission. Colorfull aims to educate people on how our eyes perceive color, and the difference in the way color blind people may view colors and their surroundings in a gamified way.
Colorfull also allows users to take pictures of their surroundings and view them from the perspective of someone who is color blind, allowing them to empathise with those who have color blindness.
